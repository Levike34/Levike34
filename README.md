-Hello, I am Levi Meadows and I am a Blockchain developer. 
I have been working with Solidity to build real-world applications
in DeFi and NFTs.  I build all of my applications from start to finish (Full-Stack) 
using the Solidity + Truffle + Web3 + React framework, and I am also working in Substrate and Solana
applications.

Currently I am working on a Metaverse-blockchain (VRMETA) and an Insurance Blockchain (CCLC) using
Substrate and ink!.  Alongside these projects, I am writing the in-game economy smart contracts for 
Pixelland (Binance), Star Alliance(Solana), and Rule the Saga(AVAX).

All of these games will be adapted to VRMETA.
