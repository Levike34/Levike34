-Hello, I am Levi Meadows and I am a Blockchain developer. 
I have been working with Solidity to build real-world applications
in DeFi and NFTs.  I build all of my applications from start to finish (Full-Stack) 
using the Solidity + Truffle + Web3 + React framework.

I have built:

Decentralized Exchanges (DEX):
clearchainlife.com/clearswap
poseidos.net/tokenswap

ICO with Vesting: clearchainlife.com/purchase

Staking + Yield Farming: poseidos.net/underworld

ArchAngel Staking front-end (Web3) - Gabriel staking.
PROFIT token staking.

NFT Market Place Airdrop: poseidos.net/gumdrop

I am confident in my skills in Solidity.  With Solidity being a Turing-complete language, I 
am sure that I can build any blockchain application I can imagine.
