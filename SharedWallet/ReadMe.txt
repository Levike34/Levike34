A full front-end is coming soon for the SharedWallet.sol files!

As of now, the wallet is functional in the sense that funds can be deposited and withdrawn via the front-end, with the total balance of the wallet displayed clearly.
I am working on integrating the allowance functionality for the Owner, as well as displaying the accounts with allowances in an array.
