This app is my Vaccination tracking app; it is deployed on the Ropsten test net.  It requires users to register first via name, then users are able to get up to two vaccinations.
The app checks if users are fully vaccinated based on their history; it requires two vaccinations to register them as fully vaccinated, and it is based on the current
environment for Covid-19 vaccination standards. This app is a proof of concept prototype, and I believe it could be further developed for real-world applications
by creating an Ownable.sol contract and extending that to front-end applications to only allow doctors/officials to change the vaccination status of certain addresses.

Try the app at: mangosugar.org/VaxProtocol

NOTE: For the app to load correctly, you must connect via metamask to the Ropsten network.
